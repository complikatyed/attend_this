# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Student.create(name: 'Tim')
# Student.create(name: 'Barney')

#  At DB setup or DB create, the seeds get added
#  Also happens at migration:  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
#  rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=development
#  rake db:create RAILS_ENV=development
